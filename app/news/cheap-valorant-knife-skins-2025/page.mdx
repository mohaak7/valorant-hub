# Cheap Valorant Knife Skins That Still Look Premium (2025)

Knife skins are where most players **waste their VP**.  
It&apos;s easy to drop 4–5k VP on a single flex, then regret not buying more gun skins instead.

This guide highlights melee skins that **feel expensive**, while staying relatively cheap for their tier.

## Smart knife rules

1. **Prioritize inspect animation and pull‑out.** You see these every round.  
2. **Avoid overpaying for variants you won&apos;t use.**  
3. Use bundles only when you actually like **2+ items** inside them.

## Good value knife examples

- Mid‑tier collections where the melee sits around **3,550–4,350 VP** but includes strong animations.  
- Older knives that rotate back into the store at their **original cheap VP cost** while the meta ignores them.

## VP cost strategy

- Think in **VP opportunity cost**: that extra 1,000 VP on a knife could be a battle pass or a solid rifle skin.  
- Track your **total VP spent on cosmetics**, not per‑item only.  
- Use this site as your **cheap price & VP cost dashboard** before you lock in your next melee.

In short: treat knife skins as **luxury items**, not your first purchase.  
Secure one or two cheap, high‑impact gun skins first – then start flexing your melee.
