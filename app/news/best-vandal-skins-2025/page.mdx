# Best Vandal Skins 2025 (Cheap & Premium Picks)

Valorant has more Vandal skins than ever, but **not all of them are worth your VP**.  
This quick guide keeps it simple and focuses on *how good a skin feels* for the price you pay.

## Cheap & value Vandal picks

- **Reaver Vandal (Premium, ~1775 VP)** – Still one of the cleanest animations and sounds in the game.  
  If you only buy one premium Vandal, Reaver is usually the cheapest "10/10 feeling" option.
- **Prime Vandal (Premium, ~1775 VP)** – Bright, crisp and still meta years later.  
  When it rotates into your store at base VP, it is a **safe, cheap long‑term investment**.

## Flex & collection picks

- **Elderflame Vandal (~2475 VP)** – Expensive and loud, but iconic.  
  Great if you want a statement skin, not great if you want *cheap VP efficiency*.
- **RGX 11z Pro Vandal (~2175 VP)** – Super clean tracers and kill sounds.  
  Costs more than Reaver/Prime, so only grab it if you really like the RGB look.

## VP cost strategy for Vandals

1. **Decide your VP budget first.** Set a hard cap, then browse.  
2. **Check base shop price vs. bundles.** Some bundles make a "premium" skin cheaper overall.  
3. Use this site to compare **estimated VP cost and price history** before you open your wallet.

Cheap rule of thumb:  
If you mainly play rifle, it&apos;s better to own **one premium Vandal you love** than three mid skins you rarely equip.
